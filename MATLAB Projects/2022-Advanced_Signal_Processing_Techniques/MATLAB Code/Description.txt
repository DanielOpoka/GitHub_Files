This folder contains the work for the following subjects:

EEP - Estimation of Emitter Position
	By using inverse filtering (acquiring the transfer function 
	of the cavity at a certain emitter and receiver position H(f)),
	the emitter position is estimated using:
	* Correlation Maximization
	* Entropy Minimization

MIS - Miscellaneous
	Practice for become familiar with signal processing, more
	specfically Fast Fourier Transform.

STA - Statistical Studies
	The Reverberation Time (time at which any signal within the 
	reverberant chamber will lose at least 75% of its energy on 
	average) is calculated through repeated simulations.

	Another study is done on the effects data smoothing such as to
	determine the number of needed antennas to acquire a similar 
	enough signal to the original.

TFA - Time Frequency Analysis
	By using methods such as STFT and the Wigner-Ville Distribution,
	useful information is extracted from simulated receiver signals
	r(t)s from a reverberant chamber.
